                Welcome to this CD shop website, which doubles as a music file uploading/playback website.

                We currently have <%= numberOfCDsInStock %> CDs in stock.

            <h3>Admin-only information:</h3>
            <p>
                You can try this unadvertised GET request: /assets/react.html. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                These routes work as POST requests (e.g. with Postman), using a jwt-based login system which is a work-in-progress, but they are not yet accessible in the UI: /api/users, /api/login. (Instead of that jwt system, a non-jwt system currently handles user creation and login at these routes: /add-user and /login.)
            </p>
